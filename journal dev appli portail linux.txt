Android difficult to handled : difficult to create a real sticky service; difficult to maintain the wifi connection (of course, difficult for me)
new architecture on linux OS :
A java app : push button GUI + UDP listener
 1 shell script to be launched by java app, it will launch firefox to get ipcam stream
base for java app :

success in copying and run udpp server from http://www.roseindia.net/java/example/java/net/udp/udp-server.shtml
failed while modifying it while attempting to start thread alone (GUI interaction) before adding udp client
http://www.roseindia.net/java/example/java/net/udp/udp-client.shtml

TO save it in GIT on first run !!!!!

2013 29 09
create UPDServer project and save it on git, success to launch it automatically and make it work on associated arduino port

2013 30 09
add call_request management
add launch of browser

2013 05 10
Create GUI app, void send data to network to be updated
anyway : both class should be in same project ? having the daemon still alive while closing the GUI could be difficult to manage

2013 07 10

GUI 1.0 "completed" : 5 buttons created with associated UDP message sent while pressed
TO DO : provide preferences settings to modify GUI size following hardware


2013 08 10
Added sound player to daemon (fix file settings)
To DO : file path defined in a file, can be edited trough the GUI

2013 09 10
Added capability to launch the GUI. GUI imported into dameon as an executable JAR file (export from Eclipse).
issue : imported as "udp_server.jar" instead of "GUI.jar" : to be investigated
other issue : not launch as front window

2013 11 10
Added file settings, fixed path to be defined : 1 for windows, 1 for linux
to do  : add exception management message " could not find file settings"
mp3 file type very sensitive

2013 12 10
merge GUI class into phonedoor service projet

2013 13 10
add GUI size reading insettings
add linux audio file path settings (not checked probably wrong)
install swing plugin to add file reading to select audio file
Jchooser to be implemented for audio file selection

2013 14 10
add audiofile chooser on the GUI
the app launches once, then doesn't work. To be fixed
TO DO : launch web browser on the camera

2013 15 10
Replace web browser launch by ipcam viewer launch : ip camera trendnet ip422 used for dev requires a login/password which seems to not be manageable

2013 16 10
Add screen saver on/off capabilities (to be optimised)
to do  : add time out to return to blank screen, add "Do what the fuck you want" license, add automatic closure  of app

2013 17 10
no need to put a time out : we just need to set the screen saver of the OS ...
DWTFL added in root directory
replace ip camera viewer by xeoma, much more friendly 


2013 26 10
add possibility to launch the GUI alone : may not work (unable to lauch 2 process on same port ;-( )
the GUI launcher would launch a copy of the GUI
MAJOR issue : unable to play sound when program is lauchned outside Eclipe IDE
